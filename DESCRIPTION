Description: The twoStepsBenchmark() and threeRuleSmooth() functions allow you to 
    disaggregate a low-frequency time-serie with higher frequency time-series, 
    using the French National Accounts methodology. The aggregated sum of the 
    resulting time-serie is strictly equal to the low-frequency serie within the 
    benchmarking window. Typically, the low-frequency serie is an annual one, 
    unknown for the last year, and the high frequency one is either quarterly or 
    monthly. See "Methodology of quarterly national accounts", Insee Méthodes 
    N°126, by Insee (2012, ISBN:978-2-11-068613-8, https://www.insee.fr/en/information/2579410).
