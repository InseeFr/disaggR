\title{Producing the in sample predictions of a prais-lm regression}
\usage{
insample(object, type = "changes")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{praislm} or \code{twoStepsBenchmark}}
}
\value{
a named matrix time-serie of two columns, one for the
response and the other for the predicted value.
A \code{insamplepraislm} class is added to the object. Then, the functions
\code{plot} and \code{autoplot} (the latter requires to load \pkg{ggplot2})
can be used to produce graphics.
}
\description{
The function \link{insample} returns in-sample predictions from
a \link{praislm} or a \link{twoStepsBenchmark} object.
}
\details{
The predicted values are different from the fitted values :
\itemize{
\item they are eventually reintegrated
\item the autocorrelated part of the residuals is added
Besides, changes are relative to the latest response value,
not the latest predicted value.
}
}
