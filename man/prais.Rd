\title{Extracting the regression of a twoStepsBenchmark}
\usage{
prais(x)

praislm(X, y, include.rho, include.differenciation, set_coefficients, cl)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a twoStepsBenchmark}
}
\value{
prais returns an object of class \code{"praislm"}.

The functions that can be used on that class are almost the same than
for the class \code{twoStepsBenchmark}.
\code{summary}, \code{coefficients}, \code{residuals} will return the same values.
However, as for \code{fitted.values}, the accessor returns the fitted values
of the regression, not the high-frequency, eventually integrated, time-serie
contained in a twoStepsBenchmark.

An object of class \code{"praislm"} is a list containing the following components :
\item{coefficients}{a named vector of coefficients.}
\item{residuals}{the residuals, that is response minus fitted values.}
\item{fitted.values}{a time-serie, the fitted mean values}
\item{se}{a named vector of standard errors.}
\item{df.residuals}{the residual degrees of freedom.}
\item{rho}{the autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals. It
is equal to zero if twoStepsBenchmark was called with \code{include.rho=FALSE}}
\item{residuals.decorrelated}{the residuals of the model after having been
transformed by rho in a least square model.}
\item{fitted.values.decorrelated}{the fitted values of the model after
having been transformed by rho in a least square model.}
}
\description{
prais extracts the regression, which is an object of class \code{"praislm"}, of a
twoStepsBenchmark object.

benchmark <- twoStepsBenchmark(turnover,construction); prais(benchmark)
