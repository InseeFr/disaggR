\title{Using the same estimated benchmark model on another time-serie}
\usage{
reUseBenchmark(hfserie,benchmark,reeval.smoothed.part=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hfserie}{the bended time-serie. If it is a matrix time-serie, it has to have the
same column names than the \code{hfserie} used for the benchmark.}

\item{benchmark}{a twoStepsBenchmark object, from which the parameters and coefficients
are taken}

\item{reeval.smoothed.part}{a boolean of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, the smoothed part is
reevaluated, hence the aggregated benchmarked serie is equal to the low-frequency serie.}
}
\value{
twoStepsBenchark returns an object of class \link{twoStepsBenchmark}.
}
\description{
This function reapplies the coefficients and parameters of a benchmark
on new time-serie.
}
\details{
reUseBenchmark is primarily meant to be used on a serie that is derived from the previous
one, after some modifications that would bias the estimation. Working-day adjustment
is a good example. Hence, by default, the smoothed part of the first model isn't
reevaluated ; the aggregated benchmarked serie isn't equal to the low-frequency serie.

\examples{
benchmark <- twoStepsBenchmark(turnover,construction) 
turnover_modif <- turnover
turnover_modif[2] <- turnover[2]+2
benchmark2 <- reUseBenchmark(turnover_modif,benchmark)
