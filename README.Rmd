## Overview

The R package disaggR is an implementation of the French Quarterly National Accounts method for temporal disaggregation of time-series. `twoStepsBenchmark()` bends a time-serie with another.

## Installation

As for now, only the development version is available, from Github.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Development version
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("arnaud-feldmann/disaggR")
```

## Usage

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide', out.width = "70%",fig.align="center"}
library(disaggR)
library(ggplot2)

benchmark <- annualBenchmark(hfserie = turnover,
                            lfserie = construction,
                            include.differenciation = TRUE)
as.ts(benchmark)
coef(benchmark)
summary(benchmark)
autoplot(in_sample(benchmark))
```
