## Purpose

* Suggested vdiffr skips if not installed, as requested by mail by Brian Ripley
* INSEE officially starts endorsing the package, as I have spent working hours developing the package INSEE should have copyright
* According to French law, software developed by a civil servant cannot be under GPL-2 license, so the package should move to MIT
* According to INSEE's internal guidelines, civil servants should contact CRAN team with an official  email address not a private one, that is why I would like to use arnaud.feldmann@insee.fr and drop my previous maintainer address (arnaud.feldmann@gmail.com)
* v0.1.11 removed the capital letters for my name and put, for LICENSE file, the CRAN MIT template
